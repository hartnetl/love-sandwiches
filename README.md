# Love Sandwiches
## By Anna Greaves, CI  

A follow along Code Institute project, Love Sandwiches, by Anna Greaves.  
The program is run in the command line, and is fully back end operational.   
It is deployed on Heroku to allow users to access the application.

It is a market stall which sells sandwiches. They make some beforehand each day (stock), 
keep track of how many are sold (sales), make extra for customers if they run out (negative surplus values) and 
throw away leftovers (positive surplus values).

## Key features:
- Link google sheet and google drive APIs to allow Python to access and edit the data
